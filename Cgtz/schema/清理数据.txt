1、删除数据
	DELETE FROM T_ACCT_APP; 
	DELETE FROM T_BULLETIN;
	DELETE FROM T_BILL_ACCT; 
	DELETE FROM T_BILL_BASE; 
	DELETE FROM T_BILL_ONLINE; 
	DELETE FROM T_BPM_LOG; 
	DELETE FROM T_BPM_TASK; 
	DELETE FROM T_CLLT_DISTR; 
	DELETE FROM T_CLLT_LOG; 
	DELETE FROM T_COLLATERAL; 
	DELETE FROM T_COLLATERAL_CHECK; 
	DELETE FROM T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_AUDIT; 
	DELETE FROM T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_CHANGE; 
	DELETE FROM T_CONTACT; 
	DELETE FROM T_CONTRACT; 
	DELETE FROM T_CONTRACT_ONLINE; 
	DELETE FROM T_FILES; 
	DELETE FROM T_INTERFACE_LOG; 
	DELETE FROM T_JUDGE_ADV; 
	DELETE FROM T_LEND_USER_LOG; 
	DELETE FROM T_LOAN_APP; 
	DELETE FROM T_LOAN_BASE; 
	DELETE FROM T_LOAN_GUAR;  
	DELETE FROM T_MARGIN_INFO; 
	DELETE FROM T_OVERDUE_ACCEPT; 
	DELETE FROM T_OVERDUE_REPORT; 
	DELETE FROM T_REPORT_ACCT; 
	DELETE FROM T_REPORT_DEAL; 
	DELETE FROM T_REPORT_OVERDUE; 
	DELETE FROM T_RET_PLAN; 
	DELETE FROM T_SALES_CHECK_LOG;  
	DELETE FROM T_SYSLOG;
	
2、删除序列（oracle-sequence.sql中的删除序列）
	drop sequence T_ACCT_APP_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_BULLETIN_SEQ;
	drop sequence T_BILL_ACCT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_BILL_BASE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_BILL_ONLINE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_BPM_LOG_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_BPM_TASK_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_CLLT_DISTR_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_CLLT_LOG_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_COLLATERAL_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_COLLATERAL_CHECK_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_AUDIT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_CHANGE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_CONTACT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_CONTRACT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_CONTRACT_ONLINE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_FILES_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_INTERFACE_LOG_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_JUDGE_ADV_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_LEND_USER_LOG_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_LOAN_APP_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_LOAN_BASE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_LOAN_GUAR_SEQ;  
	drop sequence T_MARGIN_INFO_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_OVERDUE_ACCEPT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_OVERDUE_REPORT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_REPORT_ACCT_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_REPORT_DEAL_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_REPORT_OVERDUE_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_RET_PLAN_SEQ; 
	drop sequence T_SALES_CHECK_LOG_SEQ;  
	drop sequence T_SYSLOG_SEQ;
	
3、创建序列（oracle-sequence.sql中的创建序列）
	create sequence T_ACCT_APP_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_BULLETIN_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1;
	create sequence T_BILL_ACCT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_BILL_BASE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_BILL_ONLINE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_BPM_LOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_BPM_TASK_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_CLLT_DISTR_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_CLLT_LOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_COLLATERAL_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_COLLATERAL_CHECK_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_AUDIT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_COLLATERAL_PRICE_CHANGE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_CONTACT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_CONTRACT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_CONTRACT_ONLINE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_FILES_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_INTERFACE_LOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_JUDGE_ADV_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_LEND_USER_LOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_LOAN_APP_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_LOAN_BASE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_LOAN_GUAR_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_MARGIN_INFO_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_OVERDUE_ACCEPT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_OVERDUE_REPORT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_REPORT_ACCT_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_REPORT_DEAL_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_REPORT_OVERDUE_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_RET_PLAN_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1; 
	create sequence T_SALES_CHECK_LOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1;  
	create sequence T_SYSLOG_SEQ increment by 1 start with 1;
